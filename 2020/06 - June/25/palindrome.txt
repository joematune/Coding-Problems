Task 1:

    Palindrome Checker

    Return true if the given string is a palindrome.
    Otherwise, return false.

    A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled
    the same way both forward and backward, ignoring
    punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note:

    You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything
    into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to
    check for palindromes.

    "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.

    "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2".

Examples:

    "race car"                       =>  true.
    "not a palindrome"               =>  false.
    "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama" =>  true.
    "never odd or even"              =>  true.
    "nope"                           =>  false.
    "almostomla"                     =>  false.
    "My age is 0, 0 si ega ym."      =>  true.
    "1 eye for of 1 eye."            =>  false.
    "0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0"              =>  true.
    "five|\_/|four"                  =>  false.
