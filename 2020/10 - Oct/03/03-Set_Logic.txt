Task 1:

    Given a group of three cards, determine if they are
    a 'set'. The cards will be ojects, holding four
    different categories. Each category must either be
    different from the other two cards, or all three
    must be the same.

Examples:

    input: [
        Card {
            shading: 0,
            symbol: 1,
            color: 0,
            number: 2,
        },
        Card {
            shading: 0,
            symbol: 1,
            color: 1,
            number: 0,
        },
        Card {
            shading: 0,
            symbol: 1,
            color: 2,
            number: 1,
        },
    ]
    
    output: true
